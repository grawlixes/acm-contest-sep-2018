Questions and solutions to the ACM coding competition for September 2018.
I got first place! :)

NOTE: The questions were made up by the organizers of the Binghamton ACM chapter. I had nothing
to do with their creation; I just solved them. All answers are in Python 3, read from STDIN, and
print the answers to STDOUT.
